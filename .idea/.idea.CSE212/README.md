# Overview

{Important! This is my first Java program made on my own from scratch.}

{I created a small game that can be preformed with providing input to activate switch statements for example select #2 to choose the character of a Man from the kingdom. Or select in the last half of the program #1 to attack with your sword. The first part of the program the user selects who they want to play as, the last half of the program is a switch statement nested in a loop as you attack the game boss looping through until you have defeated the boss.}

{I have never worked in detail with Java so I wanted to try learning the basics as it is a valuable language to know.}

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Future Work

{Here is a list of things I need to improve}

- I need to make this more interactive for the player with more chances for custom input;
- I will need to make it more challenging for the player to take damage.
- I need to make more notes and organize the code better so I don't get so lost in it as the lines increase.
