# Overview

{JavaScript todo list.}

{I have worked to create a webpage that functions as a todo list.}

{I needed more practice working with JavaScript so I made this small project.}

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
