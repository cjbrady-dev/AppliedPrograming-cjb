# Overview

{I made this cloud data base to better understand what exactly a cloudDB is.}

{I created a small health database storing the information of individuals health information one might gain from wearing a fitbit for example.}

{My purpose in writing this software was to improve my software engineering skills and understanding of the cloud. Writing a heath data base helped me explore my interest in the cloud.}

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running, a walkthrough of the code, and a view of the cloud database.}

# Cloud Database

{I used the Python language and used Firebase_admin.}

{The Collection is under 'Health Users' then splits into separate documents by individual and then their information.}

# Development Environment

{I used a virtual environment.}

{I used the Python language and used Firebase_admin}

# Useful Websites

- [Web Site Name](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/manage-data/add-data)
- [Web Site Name](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/admin/python)

# Future Work

{Here is a list of things that I need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- Item 1: Overall functionality of the database
- Item 2: Commenting in the code to describe what is happening.
- Item 3: Name variables pertaining to individuals in the collection.
